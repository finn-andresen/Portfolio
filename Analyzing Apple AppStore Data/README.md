# Analyzing Apple AppStore Data

## Tools
- <b>Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>: Database Setup and Data Visualization
- <b>SQL</b>: Querying and Analyzing Data


## Dataset
The dataset contains data about a selection of apps in the Apple AppStore from July 2017. It is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and includes two CSV files:
- AppleStore.csv
- AppleStore_description.csv


## Goals
A software company or an independent developer would like to develop an app for the Apple AppStore. For this purpose, it should be analyzed what appears to be the most promising for an app. The following questions should therefore be answered as part of the analysis:
- Which genre should the app belong to?
- Should the app be free or paid? If paid, at what price?
- How many languages should the app support?
- Should the app have a rather short or long description?


## Results
Please refer to the bottom part of the [AppStore.ipynb](AppStore.ipynb) file, where the results are included.


## Files
